# .lycheeignore - Link Checker Ignore Patterns
#
# This file contains regex patterns for URLs that should be ignored by the lychee link checker
# during GitHub Actions workflows. One pattern per line.
#
# Pattern Categories:
# - Example domains: Standard placeholder URLs
# - Development URLs: Local development links (localhost, etc.)
# - Social media links: Often have anti-scraping measures
# - Restricted files: Files that may require authentication
# - Local file paths: Paths that exist in production but not in CI
# - GitHub patterns: To reduce API rate limiting issues
# - Hugo-specific patterns: To handle Hugo path differences
# - Protocol-specific links: Special protocols like mailto, slack, etc.
#
# Common Pattern Syntax:
# - ^ = Start of the URL
# - $ = End of the URL
# - \. = Literal dot (escaped)
# - .* = Any character, any number of times
# - [^/]+ = One or more characters that are not a slash

# Example domains
^https?://example\.com
^https?://example\.org

# Common temporary URLs or local development URLs
^https?://localhost
^https?://127\.0\.0\.1
^https?://0\.0\.0\.0

# Social media links (often have anti-scraping measures that may cause checks to fail)
^https?://(www\.)?linkedin\.com
^https?://(www\.)?twitter\.com
^https?://(www\.)?facebook\.com
^https?://(www\.)?t\.co
